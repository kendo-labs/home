            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>You use <a href="http://www.kendoui.com" title="Kendo UI - The Way of HTML5">Kendo UI</a>, but you may not always use JUST Kendo UI in your projects. Maybe you like to use Kendo UI with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" title="Knockout JS">Knockout</a>,
            or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angularjs</a>, or even <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>. Perhaps you need a widget that's mostly like the Autocomplete, but not quite. Even though most
            3rd party libraries play just fine with Kendo UI, you may find yourself wishing for more, be it a custom DataSource for <a href="http://www.breezejs.com/">Breeze.js</a> or a
            Kendo UI Widget that combines Autocomplete with a YouTube search. Whatever it may be, Kendo UI Labs is the home for those Kendo UI
            experiments and integrations. In this organization, you'll find a myriad of sample repositories and integration libraries that we
            hope you'll find helpful as you build web and hybrid mobile apps using Kendo UI Web, DataViz and Mobile.</p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>Kendo UI Labs projects are "extensions" to Kendo UI meant to help you stay productive. Though these projects are not officially part of Kendo
            UI, and therefore not part of the supported product, they do leverage the in-depth knowledge of Kendo UI team members and customers. As such,
            you can be certain that each project in this organization has been built by people who know and use Kendo UI every day. What's more, because
            these projects are all open-source, you're more than welcome to get involved and help out if a project doesn't yet fully meet your specific needs.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Each Kendo UI Labs project is designed to provide drop-in capabilities for your apps, support for your development workflow or
            example implementations of common Kendo UI app patterns. Every repo has its own getting started guide, so feel free to pick a repo
            or two from <a href="#projects">the list below</a> and visit the project pages for each to learn more.</p>
